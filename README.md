# w01-tomatotime - What I done dang learned

## Requirements checklist

- ✔️ Ensure each section of the webpage is wrapped in the correct semantic tags, ensuring that includes a \<header\> \<nav\>, and \<footer\>

- ✔️ Implement CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image or another element.

- ✔️ Utilise CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the \<nav\> element.

- ✔️ Ensure all image elements (\<img\>) and background images are correctly implemented with accurate file paths.

- ✔️ Deploy

### Stretch goals

- ✔️ Create a “back to top” button.

- ✔️ Implement smooth scrolling for internal links to improve user experience.

- ✔️ Implement a hover effect on buttons to make them more interactive.

- ✔️ Create a basic footer with social media icons that link to social media pages.

- ❓ Add a background music track that plays automatically when the website loads.

## Reflection

I tried to plan appropriately before commencing, interacting with the example site and trying to make an estimate as to how it was achieved, then drawing a quick box plan of my idea.
I put the plan into place in a barebones HTML and CSS block model, and visually compared against the example making rough modifications until I felt the header, nav, main, and footer elements were broadly in place,

Things learned from evaluating against TT source:  
2px border beneath each section.  
Smooth scroll behaviour

No idea as of yet how audio can be auto-played without running foul of modern attempts to block doing that, but we'll see.

I've stuck annotations in the CSS file for some on-the-spot head-scratching nonsense, feel free to check 'em out.

Honestly, after feeling like I had a bit of a stumbling start this week, I'm happier than I thought I'd be with it so far

## To improve
