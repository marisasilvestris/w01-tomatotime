## Reflection

I tried to plan appropriately before commencing, interacting with the example site and trying to make an estimate as to how it was achieved, then drawing a quick box plan of my idea.  
I put the plan into place in a barebones HTML and CSS block model, and visually compared against the example making rough modifications until I felt the header, nav, main, and footer elements were broadly in place using the appropriate combinations of position: relative, position: absolute, flexbox, and viewport units.  
I themed what I had at that moment according to TT, basically just a lot of tomato colour, the occasional dark green, and using RGB background-colors to mark \<section\>s.  
At this point I used Chrome's inspect tool to compare my working model with the example site. I really should have done this before the theming step, but I just got doggone carried away, didn't I?  
Here I realised

After that, it was a matter of small adjustments until

Things learned from evaluating against TT source:  
2px border beneath each section.  
Smooth scroll behaviour

No idea as of yet how audio can be auto-played without running foul of modern attempts to block doing that, but we'll see.

I've stuck annotations in the CSS file for some on-the-spot head-scratching nonsense, feel free to check 'em out.

Honestly, after feeling like I had a bit of a stumbling start this week, I'm happier than I thought I'd be with it so far
